## Software Requirements
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Angular CLI (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (v4 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Code Editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)
- Web Browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

## Hardware Requirements
- Development Machine: Any modern PC or Mac with at least 4GB RAM and 10GB free disk space.
- Server: A server or cloud instance capable of running Node.js and MongoDB (minimum 2GB RAM recommended).
- Network: Reliable internet connection for development and deployment.

## Technical Stack

### Frontend: Angular
Angular is a popular open-source web application framework developed by Google. It allows building dynamic, single-page applications (SPAs) with a component-based architecture. Angular provides powerful tools for routing, form handling, HTTP communication, and state management, making it ideal for building responsive and maintainable user interfaces.

### Backend: Node.js and Express
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine that enables server-side scripting. Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building APIs and web servers. Together, they form a powerful backend stack for handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware, and integration with databases.

### Database: MongoDB
MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-oriented database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It is designed for scalability and performance, making it suitable for applications requiring rapid development and handling of large volumes of data. MongoDB integrates seamlessly with Node.js through native drivers and ODM libraries like Mongoose.

### Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It is commonly used for securing APIs by encoding user identity and authorization information in tokens, enabling stateless authentication and session management.

## Introduction
The Drug Inventory and Supply Chain Management System addresses the critical need for efficient management of medical supplies and patient-related processes in healthcare facilities. By automating inventory tracking, sales, verification, and staff training, the system reduces manual errors and enhances operational transparency. The integration of a chatbot and feedback system further improves communication and service quality. Built on the MEAN stack, the system leverages modern web technologies to deliver a scalable, secure, and user-friendly platform that supports healthcare providers in delivering optimal patient care.
